# autoLinkedIn

A simple, imperfect-but-working the Selenium-based freemium UI.vision robot for applying to jobs on LinkedIn. It uses only free features of the tool.

I haven't ported it to Selenium yet myself, as I haven't really had the need. Doing so should be easy enough however, and would offer finer-grain control.

Why? 
  - A great power imbalance between employers and employees.
  - Average duration of job searches have been getting longer for many years and are absurdly high.
  - Generative AI (while awesome and creating economic growth in many areas) is displacing a huge number of workers.
  - Government largely closing off its job opportunities to the public.
  - HR and collusive, slow-hiring employers greatly exacerbating the problems.
  - Inflation and economic turmoil.
  - Job seeker resources have fallen off sharply post-pandemic.
  - Tech workers have been suffering mass layoffs.
  - Ubiqitous use of "zombie" job listings.

So, this is a little tool to help reduce the applicants burden. 

## Usage

  1. Login to LinkedIn.
  2. Make sure you have a saved resume available and at least basic info saved (phone number for employers, email, etc).
  3. Replace my default search terms with yours.
  4. Play Macro!

## Pro Tips

  - Works **far** better if you've applied to many jobs already and therefore have answers to common questions saved.
  - Doesn't work on many jobs, so check the log and finish applying to ones it missed.
  - This can be easily improved by handling more cases like drop-downs and radio buttons.

## Risks 

Use this at your own risk. Possible risks:
  - Too many junk jobs creating noise in your search (high likelihood)
  - Get blocked or banned by LinkedIn (medium likelihood, mostly if you use it excessively and without human-like pauses)
  - May annoy employers and/or evil, secret bands of recruiters / HR who stalk applicants and manipulate the job market.
